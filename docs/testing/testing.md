# Testing

- This file is generated. Add project-specific instructions to `testing.local.md` in this directory.
- The separate testing phase makes sure the system has been properly tested, using integration tests that cannot be covered by unit tests
  and are not useful to cover by E2E tests.
- Especially test non-functional requirements, such as monitoring, security, performance etc.
